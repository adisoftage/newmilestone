# sustainability Ecosystem
A short guide to sustainability focused projects on HEDERA

## Introduction
*This article is not a comprehensive "sustainability for beginners" guide. It's more of a very brief (as possible) **first step** towards a guide for ecosystem-developers who wants to participate in sustainability
markets on HEDERA. Since this area is growing at a pretty crazy pace ** the information below is likely to go out date relatively quickly**. We 'll try to keep it up to date via [pull-requests](https://github.com/dubgeis/SustainabilityEcosystem/pulls)
and [issues]

## Sustainability Platforms & MarketPlaces
These are the application that you would use to work with them to develop, and sell your carbon credits following the standards. We encourage applications committed to sustainability and offsetting on HEDERE to 
submit a pull request and sign up as a demand platform.
